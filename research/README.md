## Summary of my PhD work

For my PhD thesis, I worked during 3 years on the subject ``Multiphysics modelling and simulation of the ignition transient in solid rocket motor''. This work was conducted by Prof. Marc Massot from CMAP, Ecole Polytechnique, and JoÃ«l Dupays, research enginneer at ONERA, the French Aerospace Lab.
The final manuscript is available [here](https://www.theses.fr/2022IPPAX004), and the replay of the defense can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHh0csPVN0M).

This work brought a few contributions, e.g. :
- clarification of the mathematical nature of the model describing the burning of a solid propellant (differential-algebraic system of index 1)
- choice of well-suited numerical methods for the simulation of the previous model (high-order adaptive ESDIRK methods)
- implementation of the numerical strategy in the `Vulc1D` Fortran code
- integration of the previous code as a dynamic boundary condition in the CFD toolchain CEDRE from ONERA.
- assessment through simulations of the modelling assumptions
- exploration of adaptive high-order code coupling techniques to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of simulations involving multiple solvers.


## Reasearch work at ONERA

Following my PhD defense in early 2022, I have become a research engineer at ONERA in Palaiseau, France.
My main subjects are:
- modelling and simulation of rocket propulsion and aerodynamics
- development of the adaptive code-coupling library `Rhapsopy`, which will be presented at the Coupled2023 conference, demosntrating a strategy to enable high-order adaptive coupling of multiple specialised solvers, with the added ability of performing an iterative implicit coupling, greatly improving the accuracy and stability of coupled computations.
