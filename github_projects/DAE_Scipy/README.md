#DAE-Scipy

This Python package is a specialisation of the native Python solver Radau from the Scipy library.

It enables the introduction of use of a constant mass matrix $$M$$ terential-algebraic equations up to index 3 :

	$$My' = f(t,y)$$

Extension to variable mass matrices and equations of the form $$d_t g(y) = f(t,y)$$ is in the works !
