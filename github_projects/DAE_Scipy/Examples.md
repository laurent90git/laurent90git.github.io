# Examples

Please come back later, this is still in the works :)

Here are a few example results obtained with this code.

## 1. Index-3 DAE: Pendulum

## 2. Large-Scale index-3 DAE: pendulum chain

Using the index-3 formulation of the rod constraint, it is easy to describe the movement of a chain of sequentially-linked pendulums, since no specific change of reference needs to be performed from one pendulum to the next.
Here is an example showing the free fall of chain, whose tip surprisingly falls faster than a free-falling mass. More information on this phenoeman can be found [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/29639055_The_motion_of_a_freely_falling_chain_tip).
